- Edit the set of obstacles and constraints in setup.m
- At the matlab command line, type:

    setup

- This will put necessary paths and variables into memory.
- To run the algorithm, type:

    [G Goal] = testForward([0 0], [0 1], [0 10], TEST_OBSTACLES, TEST_MARGINS)

- This performs forward propagation. To derive an optimal trajectory:

    t = GetOptimalTrajectory(G, Goal, TEST_OBSTACLES, TEST_MARGINS)

- To draw the obstacles, type:

    drawObstacles(TEST_OBSTACLES, TEST_MARGINS)

- Finally, to draw the optimal trajectory, type:
    
    drawTrajectory(t)

- The script test_bounding_trajectories.m contains some basic tests for bounds
finding, and the script test_uncertain_obstacles.m contains some basic tests
for dealing with uncertain obstacles (a planning scenario currently under
investigation). There are further test scripts in the algorithm/ directory.
